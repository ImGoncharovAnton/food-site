# food-site

This project includes several modular parts that can be reused on other projects.

The site was tested on a local server using Open Server. You can download it from the link ospanel.io

With the help of the npm package json-server, work with data is implemented, that is, receiving and transmitting data.
To get or write data to the database, just run json-server in the console and refer to the db.json file.

The calculator now saves the selection of values in the browser's local storage

The scripts are imported into the main script.js file.
In this file, you can set parameters for: tabs, modal window, timer, forms and slider.
Thus, these modules can be reused elsewhere on the site or in other projects.
